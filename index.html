   <h1>Platypus</h1>
   <p>
    The platypus is one of the most unusual animals in the world, 
    often described as a living puzzle of nature. Native to Australia, 
    it has the bill and webbed feet of a duck, the tail of a beaver, 
    and the body of an otter, making it a truly unique mammal. 
    Unlike most mammals, the platypus lays eggs, and the males possess 
    venomous spurs on their hind legs, a rare trait among mammals. 
    Excellent swimmers, they spend much of their time in rivers and streams, 
    using their sensitive bills to detect prey like insects, larvae, and small 
    crustaceans. With its mix of features and behaviors, the platypus challenges 
    traditional ideas of classification and continues to fascinate scientists and 
    nature enthusiasts alike.
